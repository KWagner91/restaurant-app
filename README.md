# Udacity Restaurant Reviews App
This project is part of Udacity's Nanodegree "Front End Web Developer".
> For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Specification

You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The following tools where used to improve the provided starter code:
- Mapbox API
- Responsive Design using Flexbox
- ARIA a11y standards
- Service Worker for an offline-first approach

### Download and open Project

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. 

2. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
